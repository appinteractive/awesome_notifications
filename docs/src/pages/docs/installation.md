## flutter pub add

```dart
flutter pub add awesome_notifications
```

This will add a line like this to your package's `pubspec.yaml` (and run an implicit flutter pub get):

```yaml
dependencies:
  awesome_notifications: ^0.7.4+1
```

Alternatively, your editor might support flutter pub get. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.

## Import package

Now in your Dart code, you can use:

```dart
import 'package:awesome_notifications/awesome_notifications.dart';
```

title: Extra iOS Setup for Background Actions
# description: Quidem magni aut exercitationem maxime rerum eos.
---

On iOS, to use any plugin inside background actions, you will need to manually register each plugin you want. Otherwise, you will face the `MissingPluginException` exception.
To avoid this, you need to add the following lines to the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method in your iOS project's AppDelegate.m/AppDelegate.swift file:

```swift
import Flutter
import awesome_notifications
import shared_preferences_ios
//import all_other_plugins_that_i_need

override func application(
    _ application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
  ) -> Bool {
      GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: self)

      // This function registers the desired plugins to be used within a notification background action
      SwiftAwesomeNotificationsPlugin.setPluginRegistrantCallback { registry in
          SwiftAwesomeNotificationsPlugin.register(
            with: registry.registrar(forPlugin: "io.flutter.plugins.awesomenotifications.AwesomeNotificationsPlugin")!)
          FLTSharedPreferencesPlugin.register(
            with: registry.registrar(forPlugin: "io.flutter.plugins.sharedpreferences.SharedPreferencesPlugin")!)
      }

      return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
  }
```

And you can check how to correctly call each plugin opening the file `GeneratedPluginRegistrant.m`

**PLUGIN UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

_Working progress percentages of awesome notifications plugin_

{% callout type="warning" title="flutter_local_notifications" %}
awesome_notifications plugin is incompatible with flutter_local_notifications, as both plugins will compete each other to accquire global notification resources to send notifications and to receive notification actions.

So, you MUST not use flutter_local_notifications with awesome_notifications. Awesome Notifications contains all features available in flutter_local_notifications plugin and more, so you can replace totally flutter_local_notifications in your project.
{% /callout %}

{% callout type="warning" title="firebase_messaging" %}
The support for firebase_messaging plugin is now deprecated, but all other firebase plugins are still being supported. And this happened by the same reason as flutter_local_notifications, as both plugins will compete each other to accquire global notification resources.

To use FCM services with Awesome Notifications, you need use the Awesome Notifications FCM add-on plugin.

Only using awesome_notifications_fcm you will be capable to achieve all Firebase Cloud Messaging features + all Awesome Notifications features. To keep using firebase_messaging, you gonna need to do workarounds with silent push notifications, and this is disrecommended to display visual notifications and will result in several background penalities to your application.

So, you MUST not use firebase_messaging with awesome_notifications. Use awesome_notifications with awesome_notifications_fcm instead.
